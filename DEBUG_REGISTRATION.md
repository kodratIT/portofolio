# 🐛 Debug Registration Bug - FIXED

## 🔴 Bug Report

**Symptom:**
- User registers with form
- Shows error: "Registrasi gagal"
- But user IS created in Firebase Authentication
- User can login successfully after

## 🔍 Root Cause

The bug occurs when:
1. ✅ Firebase Authentication creates user successfully
2. ❌ Firestore document creation fails (Firestore not enabled or wrong rules)
3. ❌ Error is caught and shows "registrasi gagal"

**Why this happens:**
- Firebase Auth is enabled by default in project
- Firestore Database needs to be manually created
- Registration flow tries to write to Firestore
- When Firestore unavailable → error thrown → user sees failure
- But Auth user already created → can login

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Improved Error Logging (`src/lib/firebase/auth.ts`)

Added detailed logging at each step:
```typescript
✅ User created in Firebase Auth: [uid]
✅ User profile updated
❌ Firestore Error: [specific error code and message]
```

### 2. Better Error Messages (`src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`)

Now shows specific errors:
- ⚠️ User created but Firestore access denied
- ⚠️ User created but Firestore is not enabled
- Plus direct link to fix in console

### 3. Diagnose Tool (`src/lib/firebase/diagnose.ts`)

New utility to test all Firebase services:
- Tests Auth connection
- Tests Firestore write
- Tests Storage upload
- Returns detailed status

## 🧪 How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) and register again. You'll see:

**If Firestore not enabled:**
```
✅ User created in Firebase Auth: abc123
✅ User profile updated
❌ Firestore Error: unavailable
Full error: [error details]
🔥 FIRESTORE NOT ENABLED! Enable at: [link]
```

**If Firestore rules deny:**
```
✅ User created in Firebase Auth: abc123
✅ User profile updated
❌ Firestore Error: permission-denied
Full error: [error details]
🔥 FIRESTORE NOT CONFIGURED! Check: [link]
```

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic Tool

Open browser console on any page and run:
```javascript
import { diagnoseFirebase } from '@/lib/firebase/diagnose';
diagnoseFirebase();
```

This will test all services and show which one is failing.

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Option A: Enable Firestore (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/portofolio-ecd0d/firestore
2. **Click:** "Create database"
3. **Select:** "Start in test mode"
4. **Location:** asia-southeast1 (or closest)
5. **Click:** "Enable"
6. **Wait:** ~30 seconds

### Option B: Update Firestore Rules

If Firestore exists but rules deny:

1. **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/portofolio-ecd0d/firestore/rules
2. **Replace with:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
3. **Click:** "Publish"

## 🧪 Test After Fix

### 1. Clear Test User (Optional)

If you created test users, delete them:
- https://console.firebase.google.com/project/portofolio-ecd0d/authentication/users

### 2. Test Registration Flow

```bash
1. Open: http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Daftar di sini"
3. Fill form:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: newtest@example.com
   - Password: test123
   - Confirm: test123
4. Click "Daftar"
5. Check browser console
```

**Expected:**
```
Starting registration...
✅ User created in Firebase Auth: [uid]
✅ User profile updated
✅ User profile created in Firestore
Toast: "Registrasi berhasil! Selamat datang!"
Redirect to /dashboard
```

### 3. Verify in Console

**Authentication:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/portofolio-ecd0d/authentication/users
→ Should see new user

**Firestore:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/portofolio-ecd0d/firestore/data
→ Should see "users" collection with document

## 📊 Error Types Explained

| Error Code | Meaning | Fix |
|------------|---------|-----|
| `permission-denied` | Firestore rules deny write | Update Firestore rules |
| `unavailable` | Firestore not created | Create Firestore database |
| `not-found` | Collection doesn't exist | Normal, will be created automatically |
| `unauthenticated` | User not logged in | Normal during registration |

## 🎯 Prevention

To prevent this bug in future:

1. **Always check console logs** during development
2. **Test all Firebase services** before deploying
3. **Enable all services** early in setup
4. **Use diagnostic tool** to verify setup

## 📝 Checklist

After applying fix, verify:

- [ ] Error messages are clearer (shows Firestore issue)
- [ ] Console logs show specific step that failed
- [ ] Toast notification shows helpful error (with ⚠️ icon)
- [ ] Direct link to Firebase Console in error
- [ ] Firestore is enabled
- [ ] Registration creates both Auth user AND Firestore document
- [ ] User can login after successful registration
- [ ] Dashboard shows user profile correctly

## 🚀 Quick Fix Command

```bash
# Check if Firestore is enabled
# Open browser console and run:
fetch('https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/portofolio-ecd0d/databases/(default)/documents/test/test')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Firestore:', d))
  .catch(e => console.error('Firestore not enabled:', e));
```
